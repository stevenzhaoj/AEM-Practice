## Tutorial

A corresponding [tutorial is available](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/getting-started-wknd-tutorial-develop/overview.html) where you can learn how to implement a website using the latest standards and technologies in AEM Sites.

## How to use

Pre-compiled AEM packages are available under the latest release for easy installation on local environments using [CRX Package Manager](http://localhost:4502/crx/packmgr/index.jsp)

Setup your local development environment for [AEM as a Cloud Service SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/local-development-environment-set-up/overview.html) or for [older versions of AEM](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/foundation/development/set-up-a-local-aem-development-environment.html).

## Notes

### WKND Sample Content

By default, sample content from `ui.content.sample` will be deployed and installed along with the WKND code base. The WKND reference site is used for demo and training purposes and having a pre-built, fully authored site is useful. However, the behavior of including a full reference site (pages, images, etc...) in source control is *unusual* and is **not** recommended for a real-world implementation.

Including `ui.content.sample` will **overwrite** any authored content during each build. If you wish to disable this behavior modify the [filter.xml](ui.content.sample/src/main/content/META-INF/vault/filter.xml) file and update the `mode=merge` attribute to avoid overwriting the paths.

```diff
- <filter root="/content/wknd" />
+ <filter root="/content/wknd" mode="merge"/>
```
